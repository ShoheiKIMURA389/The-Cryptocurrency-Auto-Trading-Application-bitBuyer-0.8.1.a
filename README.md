The details of this project can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/ShoheiKIMURA389/The-Cryptocurrency-Auto-Trading-Application-bitBuyer-0.8.1.a/wiki) (in Japanese).

This project includes a dedicated [Discord Support Lounge](https://discord.gg/Gt2u4ptjGD), where I also provide an English-only channel for users.<br>
However, even considering Tokyo time, [Shohei KIMURA](https://share.evernote.com/note/13987e43-d704-0046-8e37-595bdb942672)'s responses may occasionally be delayed by a few hours. This is because I use the ChatGPT Plus plan to avoid unintended misunderstandings when communicating in English, and there are times when I reach its usage limit.<hr>
I only upload major updates to this repository.<br>
